# Snake_Game
This retro-inspired Snake game brings back the charm of the original arcade experience with a custom twist. In this version, players control a pixel-style snake on a minimalist grid. The objective is to eat as much food as possible, growing the snake longer with each item consumed. Each bite increases the snake's length and speed, making it progressively harder to maneuver.

Designed to mimic the simplicity of old-school games, this version features basic controls, allowing players to guide the snake in four directions (up, down, left, and right) using the arrow keys or touch gestures. The snake must avoid colliding with the screen edges and its own body, creating an intense challenge as the game progresses. Every point adds to the playerâ€™s score, which is displayed in a classic score tracker, encouraging players to beat their high scores with each play.

The game also includes subtle sound effects, a score-tracking system, and a retro color palette to add authenticity to the experience. For added difficulty, food items can appear randomly across the screen, requiring the player to stay sharp and plan their moves carefully. With its nostalgic design and smooth gameplay, this Snake game delivers a satisfying throwback to classic arcade fun
